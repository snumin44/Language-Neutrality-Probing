#  🍊 Probing Language Neutrality of Multilingual Representations
> __Title : Revisiting the Language Neutrality of Pre-trained Multilingual Representations through Contrastive Learning__ 

## 1. Introduction 
- __Language Neutrality__, which is often called language agnostic nature, has been treated as a core concept in the field of multilingual PLMs. Since the pre-trained multilingual representations is projected ​​into the unified vector space regardless of its language, it can represent universal meaning if the representations do not include characteristics of each language.
- It is believed that the language neutrality can be improved by alleviating the subspaces of each language in the vector space(Liboviky et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021; Choenni and Shoutova, 2020; Xie et al., 2024). To verify this, we analyze how __Contrastive Learning__, which aligns the embeddings of each language, affects the PLM's language recognition.

## 2. Probing Method

- A __Probing Classifier__ is used to analyze language discrimination ability of multilingual PLMs. If the PLMs' represenation
